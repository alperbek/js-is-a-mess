A list of tools and frameworks used for web technologies.

These days there seem to be more JavaScript & web tools than there are
pokémons.  In order to keep track of them and what there are for, I wanted to
have a simple list that I could refer to when someone mention a new tool (that
would of course solve all my problems).

This is a json document of alphabetically sorted items with self explanatory
fields.
