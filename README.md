These days there seem to be more JavaScript & web tools than there are
pokémons.  In order to keep track of them and what there are for, I wanted to
have a simple list that I could refer to.

This is a json document of alphabetically sorted items with self explanatory
fields.

(Note: the title does not reflect on my opinion about those libraries, I
actually use and enjoy many of them).
